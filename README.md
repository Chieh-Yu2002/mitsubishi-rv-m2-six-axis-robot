# mitsubishi-rv-m2-six-axis-robot
The primary objective of this project was to create a detailed model of the six-joint robotic arm, focusing on the kinematic calculations and path planning required for its movement. Additionally, the project explores the variations in key parameters such as six-axis variables, speed, and acceleration.
